### Once ended ...

All the code, including this post is published in [my github](https://github.com/mandrewcito/AdventOfCode2020)

As a personal recommendation i encourage anybody to participate. I think that this kind of events improve your skills as a developer, and for me was a good way to remember some things that i used to do on my degree but i don't do on day a day work. So this was funny.

Did you participate in AoC2020 or something similar?, feel free to leave any thought below :)
