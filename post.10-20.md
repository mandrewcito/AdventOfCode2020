[Day 11: Seating System](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/11)

Problem wasn´t hard, but i think that this was too long (at least for me). This problem remembered me to a practice on my computer science degree. It was a flooding algorithm and i solve day 11´s problem  in a similar way.

[Day 12: Rain Risk](https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/12)

This was a navigation problem i didn't need something complex with cos, sin math functions was enough. when ships needs to move forward movement was calculate with that functions.

```python
import math

(x, y) = movement * round(math.cos(math.radians(self.degree_offset))), movement * round(math.sin(math.radians(self.degree_offset)))

# movement * 0 , movement * -1 
```
